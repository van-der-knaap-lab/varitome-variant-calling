This folder contains some scripts that I used to make my life easier. However,
due to low priority or time constraints, these scripts are void of documentation
and are fairly hard-coded to my personal set up. I put them in this folder so that
you may be helpful for you. Notably, processFile.py can be VERY useful when downlaoding
many bam files from online.
